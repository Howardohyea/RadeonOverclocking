# RadeonOverclocking
Overclocking guide for AMD Radeon GPUs. This guide specifically focuses on the RDNA cards, which is RX 5000 series and above. I am not covering the Polaris and Vegas. 

For the actual guide, please click [here](Radeon%20Overclocking.md)

## About
I've seen a [Nvidia Overclocking guide](https://github.com/LunarPSD/NvidiaOverclocking) on GitHub, as well as an [DDR4 OC guide](https://github.com/integralfx/MemTestHelper). Yet there's nothing for AMD cards, and as an owner of an RX 6900XT, I was frustrated by the lack of information avalible, so I compiled everything from the internet and combined it with my own experience to form this guide. I hope you can learn something from here!

These guides are my passion projects, it's what I like to do. 

## Reporting issues
I might make some stupid mistakes, like spelling or incorrect formatting. In that case, submit an issue [right here](https://github.com/Howardohyea/RadeonOverclocking/issues) to let me know. 

The same goes for incorrect information which I haven't noticed when writing, just submit an issue, or if you want to fix it youself, see [Contribute](#contribute).

## Submitting Questions
Since GitHub doesn't have a very good comment system, just use [issues](https://github.com/Howardohyea/RadeonOverclocking/issues) to ask a question, and I'll respond.

## Contribute
If you feel like you have some changes or anything you want to implement, just make a fork of `RadeonOverclocking`, do your edit, then submit a pull request back to this project. I'm quite busy these days so any additional information is greatly appreciated.
